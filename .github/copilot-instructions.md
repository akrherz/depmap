Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. 
You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

## Rules

- Do not add code comments detailing what you modified. Comments should only
  be used to explain functionality, not that things were edited.
- Do not attempt to run node for testing purposes.
- Do not use Jquery and replace any jQuery code with vanilla JavaScript.
- Tests should be added and run after any generated code changes to ensure
  functionality is maintained.
